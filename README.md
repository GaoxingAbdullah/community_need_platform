Community Needs Platform 
This platform would connect community members with local organizations and resources to address specific needs within the community. 
Users could log onto the platform, search for resources based on their specific needs (e.g. food assistance, housing, job training), 
and find information on local organizations that can provide that help. The platform also allows community members to 
submit requests for resources that are not currently available, and allow organizations to post information about 
volunteer opportunities or upcoming events. Additionally, the platform provides a space for community members 
to connect and discuss community issues, and share information and resources with each other. this what am working on.

 	The idea of allowing users to search for resources based on specific needs and connecting 
	them with local organizations that can provide that help is a great way to streamline the
	process of finding assistance. 

 	Additionally, the ability for community members to submit requests for resources that are 
	not currently available and for organizations to post volunteer opportunities and events 
	can help ensure that the platform is meeting the changing needs of the community. 
    
 	The feature of providing a space for community members to connect and discuss 
	issues and share information and resources with each other is also a great idea,
	 as it allows for community engagement and empowerment.
